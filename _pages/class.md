## MAE 5XX Fundamentals for Legged Robots (Animaloid and Humanoid)
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:10pt;">
 This class will be offered in Fall 2025. <br>
</p>  

### Discription:
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:10pt;">
Robotic systems have increasingly integrated planning and control algorithms to operate effectively in the real world. Legged robots, such as quadrupedal robots and bipedal humanoid robots, are designed to navigate challenging terrains and perform a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks, including autonomous inspection, transportation, and more. This course covers the fundamental principles of planning and control for legged robots. Topics include kinematic and dynamic modeling, floating-base dynamics, contact dynamics, hierarchical control frameworks, whole-body control, locomotion control, and trajectory generation techniques. These concepts will be illustrated with practical examples from quadrupedal and bipedal robots. The course emphasizes practical and applied approaches to planning and control, focusing on quadrupedal and humanoid robots. <br>
</p>  

### Format:
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:10pt;">
The course will include two weekly lectures, four homework assignments, and a final project. The lectures will cover fundamental concepts such as rigid-body dynamics, optimal control theory, and planning and control techniques for modern robotics, with a particular focus on methods applicable to legged robots, including humanoid and animaloid robots. The assignments will emphasize practical implementation, requiring students to do simulation of locomotion gaits and solve coding problems related to the covered topics. For the final project, students will define their own problem and develop at least one solution using simulation tools. <br>
</p>

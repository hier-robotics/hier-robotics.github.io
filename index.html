The <b>Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics (HIER) Lab</b> focuses on both theoretical and experimental research in the field of <b>legged loco-manipulation</b> for real-world robotic deployment. 
Our research seeks to advance the fundamentals of agile and versatile loco-manipulation in environments where humans and robots coexist, as well as in wildlife settings. The detailed scope of research in our group includes the following areas: 1) Formulating planning and control frameworks for <b>autonomous task execution</b>.
2) Investigating <b>hybrid dynamical systems</b> with multiple contacts. 3) Developing <b>innovative hardware</b> for more efficient and versatile mission completion. 4) Applying <b>learning techniques</b> to devise adaptable solutions for complex problems. 5) Integrating <b>generative AI</b> with dynamically consistent motion primitives.
